1. In a large bowl, proof yeast with the warm water and sugar.
1. Mix in milk, egg, and salt.
1. Slowly incorporate flour until a soft dough forms.
1. On a floured surface, knead dough for several minutes.
1. Coat the inside of a large clean bowl with oil. Place dough in bowl and cover. Allow to rise until doubled (about an hour).
1. Fold garlic into dough.
1. Pinch dough into handfuls large enough to form golf-ball-sized pieces. This should form about 14 balls.
1. Dust dough balls with a generous amount of flour before pressing.
1. Using a roller or tortilla press, flatten dough balls between pieces of wax paper.
1. Preheat large pan with medium-high to high heat.
1. Coat grill with butter before grilling each piece, brushing the top of the dough before flipping.
1. Grill 2-3 minutes per side or until dough begins to brown and expand.

Goes well with just about anything savory. Leftovers stack and freeze well. Throw it under a broiler with some sauce and cheese and you have flatbread pizza.
